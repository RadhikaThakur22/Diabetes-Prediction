# Diabetes-Prediction
A diabetes prediction model was developed using Python and machine learning techniques to classify individuals based on their likelihood of having diabetes. 
The process began with data preprocessing, where missing and zero values in critical features such as glucose, insulin, BMI, and blood pressure were handled appropriately. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand feature distributions, detect outliers, and identify correlations.es.
Features with the highest impact were selected based on correlation analysis and importance scores. Several classification algorithms were implemented, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Among these, the Random Forest classifier delivered the highest accuracy of approximately 82%. The modelâ€™s performance was assessed using evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve. 
The project demonstrated the effective application of machine learning in healthcare and provided insights into early-stage diabetes detection through data-driven approach
The trained model was deployed using Flask, with a simple web interface developed to allow users to input patient data and receive real-time predictions. This deployment streamlined the prediction process, enabling accessible and efficient identification of at-risk individuals. The integration of a user-friendly interface with the machine learning model highlighted the practical applicability of data science in healthcare and showcased the potential for real-world implementation.
